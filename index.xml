      <description>I recently spent about 2hrs to learn rust-lang by following this guide - The Rust Programming Language.
I wrote down some notes and thoughts about the experiences.
This is the first part.
Install Rust on macOS X  $ curl &amp;ndash;proto &amp;lsquo;=https&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash;tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
 The installation process was quite nice. Everything was quite smooth and fast ⚡️. Not quite sure if it was because I chose 1) which is the default installation.</description>
